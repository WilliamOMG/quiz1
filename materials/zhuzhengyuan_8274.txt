 6. Through a web interface (page), allow user to give a picture name (file name) and you show the picture name (file name)
    and the corresponding picture (or show "no picture available").



@app.route("/people_by_img", methods=['POST'])
def search_people_by_img():
    img_name = request.form['img_name'].split('.')[0]
    print('zzz', img_name)
    df = pd.read_csv(curr_file, engine='python')
    resp = []
    for _, line in df.iterrows():
        if line[4] and isinstance(line[4], str):
            if line[4]==img_name or line[4].split('.')[0]==img_name:
                resp.append([line[0], './files/'+line[4]])
                    
    return render_template("people_by_img.html", people=resp)






 7. (Web Page) allow a user to give an ID and you show the corresponding picture, and caption (last column). 



@app.route("/people_by_id", methods=['POST'])
def search_people_by_id():
    stu_id = request.form['stu_id']
    df = pd.read_csv(curr_file, engine='python')
    resp = []
    for _, line in df.iterrows():
        if line[1] != ' ' and not math.isnan(float(line[1])):
            if stu_id == line[1]:
                if isinstance(line[4], str):
                    resp.append([line[0], './files/'+line[4], line[5]])
    
    return render_template("people_by_id.html", grade_resp=resp)




 8. (Web page) allow a user to give a name (first column) then modify the caption, then after the caption is modified,
     you display the corresponding name, picture, and caption.


@app.route("/change_info", methods=['POST'])
def change_people_info():
    ppl = request.form['change_people']
    val = request.form['target_value']
    
    df = pd.read_csv(curr_file, engine='python')
    df.at[df['Name']==ppl, 'Caption'] = val
    info = df.values.tolist()
    df.to_csv(curr_file, index=False)
    try:
        img_url = './files/'+ df[df['Name']==ppl].Picture.values[0]
    except:
        img_url = ''
    
    return render_template("change_info.html", info=info, img_url=img_url)



 9. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 5, 6, 7, 8

 10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
